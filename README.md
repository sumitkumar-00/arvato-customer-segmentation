 ### Installation <a name='Installation'></a>

This project makes use of pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn and datetime packages. All of these are available in Anaconda distribution of Python. This code should execute successfully using Python version 3.*

### Project Overview <a name='Project-Overview'></a>

In this project, I analyzed demographic data of general population and of customers of a mail-order company in Germany. This data was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and cannot be made public. The purpose of this analysis was to do customer segmentation so that individuals in general population with high probability of becoming customers can be targeted for a marketing campaign. Another goal of this project was to come up a machine learning model to predict response of a mailout campaign i.e. an individual would convert to a customer or not.
